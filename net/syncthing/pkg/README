Starting Syncthing
==================

There are two ways to start Syncthing.

The first way is to use the included rc script to start syncthing as a
system service. This is fine for single user setups. Under this mode of
operation, Syncthing will run as the _syncthing user and store the
default 'Sync' folder under /var/syncthing.

The other way is to simply invoke ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/syncthing manually.
This is a better choice for situations where several users all want to
run their own instances of Syncthing. Under this mode, the default
'Sync' folder will be stored in the user's home directory. Users will
have to configure Syncthing to listen on different TCP ports for this
method to work.
