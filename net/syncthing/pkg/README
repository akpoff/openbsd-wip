Starting Syncthing
==================

There are two ways to start Syncthing.

The first way is to use the included rc script to start Syncthing as a
system service. This is fine for single user setups. Under this mode of
operation, Syncthing will run as the _syncthing user and store the
default 'Sync' folder under /var/syncthing.

The other way is to simply invoke ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/syncthing manually.
This is a better choice for situations where several users all want to
run their own instances of Syncthing. Under this mode, the default
'Sync' folder will be stored in the user's home directory. Users will
have to configure Syncthing to listen on different TCP ports for this
method to work.

In multi user setups it might be desirable to have syncthing executed
on system reboot for each user individually. To achieve this a crontab
entry can be created on per-user basis:

@reboot tmux new-session -d '${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/syncthing'

this entry will result in a new tmux session being spawned for that
user on each system boot. The user can later on tmux attach to that
session to view and control his syncthing process. Keep in mind
that you might have to set different ports for each user before
setting up cron jobs.
