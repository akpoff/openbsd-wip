Installed
=========

cd_disect       Display SCSI / ATAPI device information.  Untested.

cd_sessions     Optical device session management.  Untested.

mmc_format      Format optical media.  Untested.

newfs_udf       Format a filesystem

udfclient       Read or write to a filesystem

udfdump         Display contents of a filesystem

Issuing any command without options will produce a short summary of
options.

Considerations
==============

Interoperability with mount_udf(8)
----------------------------------
This requires a 2048-byte block size, as mount_udf() is intended for use
with optical drives.  Such filesystems are unlikely to be interoperable
with other OSes unless placed on optical media.  Other blocksizes (such
as 512 or 4096-byte, used with disk drives) will not be mountable.

Use use a 2048 byte blocksize when formatting a filesystem, and
explicitly with udfclient in order to be able to use mount_udf().

UDF root directory
------------------

The UDF root directory is named with colon separated strings.

  "<volume set>:<primary volume>:<logical volume>:<additional tag>"

The udfclient requires a 'cd' into this root directory before you can
read or write files and directories.

udfclient interactive commands
------------------------------

These are ftp-like, with some differences.  Use the 'help' command at
the "UDF>" prompt to display a short summary of them.

Of particular value is a 'get' or 'put' of a directory.  This will copy
the entire structure in or out of the filesystem.

Example
=======

$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir test.directory
$ touch test.directory/{a,b,c,d}
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.iso bs=10m count=10
$ newfs_udf -S test -P test -L test test.iso
$ udfclient -W test.iso
